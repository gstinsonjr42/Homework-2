# Homework-2
This homework project is made up of 3 different html pieces
the first,index.html, is the home page which introduces a little bit about who I am. I use the colors of the sacramento kings to decorate the page because I am a big kings fan.
the second, contact.html, is a card in which gives my contact information and also displays the description of myself. I use the colors purple and gold to represent my two favorite sports teams: the sacramento kings and the pittsburgh steelers
the third, portfolio.html, is made up of 5 different images that i felt well represented my personality.
